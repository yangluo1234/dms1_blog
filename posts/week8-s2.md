## Project Process - Audio ##

![sound](sound_setting.jpg)

<p>To show the different between the indoor and outdoor spaces in my environment, I used two very different sound designs. Inside the house, I created a sound environment that is full of technology. You can hear the sounds of notifications, keyboard or mouse typing, showing a life focused on tech. This reflects how I felt during the pandemic when I was mostly indoors and surrounded by technology. </p>

<p>When the player moves outside, the sound change completely. The outdoor space is fulled with nature sounds, like bird chirping, giving a feeling of peace and freedom. I also added background music, which starts playing as soon as the player steps out of the house, showing the change from the indoor to the open, natural environment.</p> 

## Sound Trigger ##

<p>I faced a technical problem while working on my sound design. I wanted the background music to start playing when the player leaves the indoor space. To solve this, I created a gameobject near the door and wrote a trigger script. I also added a box collider, so when the player enters the area covered by the box collider, the music is triggered. </p>

<p>This solution worked well and allowed me to achieve the smooth transition I wanted between the indoor and outdoor space. I am so excited to keey learning how to solve similar challenges in Unity</p>
