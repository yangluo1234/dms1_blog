## Class Task ##

In the class, I started learning the basics of Figma and explored how it can be used to create a scrolling webpage. I began by setting up a frame and adding initial content to it, which gave me a better sense of how to organise elements for a cohesive design. I practised Figma’s Pen tool to create custom paths and shapes, useful for unique, hand-drawn elements. I also worked with the Shape tool and boolean operations, which allowed me to combine shapes efficiently through intersecting or subtracting them. My screenshot shows how these tools helped me build my initial layout quickly and effectively.

Additionally, I found Figma’s shortcuts to be extremely useful. Learning these shortcuts helped speed up my workflow and made it easier to focus on the creative aspects of prototyping. 

## Project Process ## 

**Designer Bio**

With a background in front-end development, I’ve transitioned into digital design to create visuals that go beyond function and resonate emotionally. My work blends vibrant colours, playful forms, and user-friendly aesthetics, inviting connection and ease. Recently, I designed graphic icons that bring joy to everyday interactions, using design as a language without words. My goal is to craft digital art that not only serves a purpose but also brings a touch of delight, combining technical skill with a human-centred, creative approach.

**Visual Expression in Figma**

In this project, my goal was to create a profile webpage that reflects my design style and interests. Coming from a background as a software developer, I can take a webpage from prototype to a fully coded version. This experience has shaped my focus on logical structure and organized layouts in web design.

For this profile page, I wanted to go beyond functionality and bring in a colorful, playful style. Inspired by themes like Lego and Super Mario, I aimed for a design that’s vibrant but balanced, full of color without overwhelming the viewer. This playful style reflects my personality and my intention to create designs that feel light-hearted and enjoyable.

 I also created a cartoon-like avatar to represent myself, which aligns with the cheerful, playful feel I want to bring to my designs. As a nod to my coding background, I added the phrase "Hello World" to the avatar. This small detail highlights my roots in programming while fitting seamlessly into the cartoon style.
