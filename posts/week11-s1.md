## Class Task##

In class, I created a wireframe for Google's desktop and mobile based on my memory.I noticed some slight differences. This comparison was helpful because it highlighted key layout details I initially missed and helped me better understand the importance of precision in UI design. There are few points I got from the comparison: 

1. Responsive Adjustments: I missed a few changes that Google makes between desktop and mobile, liking icon resising and padding adjustments, which enhance suability on smaller screens. These responsive design reminded me of the need to refine designs for different devices.

2. Spacing: my wireframe captured the main elements, but I missed the details like spacing. The use of spacing can keep the interface clean and user-friendly and I am going to implement this to my webpage. 

## Project Process ##

**Layout Draft**

The use of a clear grid layout creats strong alignment and makes the layout easy to follow. In my layout draft, the blocks organised for various section such as text paragraphs, images and buttons. This structure works well for both desktop and mobile. However, the wrireframe looks too simple and organised that cannot reflect I am a designer. To enhance my webpage and reflect my identity as a digital media student and UI designer, I may use more colours and artistic elements while keeping the structure functional organised.

I will choose a bold, cohesive colour palette to create visual interest without overwhelming the design. I could use contrasting colours like blue, green, yellow to hightlight sections and buttons. And for the typography and iconography, I will use modern, slightly playful font for headings or section titles to add a bit of personality, while keeping body text in a simpler font for readability. Additionally, colourful icons or buttons reinforce my identity as a digital media and design student.
