<p>I choose a scene from The Ring 2 for my storyboard practice. Although I am not particularly skilled at drawing, I have managed to capture the key elements of the scene. Even though this is just a practice exercise, it has deepened my understanding of storyboard and will be helpful for my assignments. </p>

**Storyboard from Assignment 1** 

<p>The storyboard will feature scenes where a recurring red light flashes, creating a visual rhythm that reflects the anxiety theme. The red light will alternate with different objects that appear trapped,such as fluttering strips, flowers, paper cups and toy cars.</p>

<p>To establish and maintain continuity in my work, I will use the red light consistently throughout the scenes. The consistent appearance of the red light will help create a coherent visual narrative, guiding the viewer through the emotional journey of anxiety. Additionally, the repetition of red light with specific objects will reinforce the theme of being stuck and unable to move forward.</p>

**About Editing Approach**
<p>The editing will focus on emphasising the repetition and significance of the red light, using it to create a sense of unease. By cutting between the red light and the objects, the editing will highlight the tension between the desire to the feeling of being trapped. Moreover, I will use sound to complement the visual rhythm and enhancethe overall emotional experience. </p>
