## Assignment 1 - Video Edit ##

**How did you approach the relationship betwwen the sonic and visual components of your edit?**

<p>I synchronised the intensity of flashing red lights with the rise in audio volume and tension in the music to reflect heightened anxiety. This interaction between sound and visuals created a more immersive experience and emphasised key emontional moments.</p>

**How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?**

<p>The close-ups of struggling objects like fluttering straps and toy cars visually represented my sense of stagnation. I also selectd footage that offered transitions from trapped moments to more open, free-flowing imagery, aligning with my journey from anxiety to resolve</p>

**How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?**

<p>In my vedio, I will use strong music at the beginning to establish a rhythmic tempo to catch the viewers' attention. As the red light starts flashing, the sound will grow louder with background music. And I use quick cuts synchronised with the peak of the background music to bring all the trapped objects together, creating a tense and nervous atmosphere. The rhythm and tempo change significantly in the final part of my vedio, where the background music transitions to a bright and brisk tone. This change in pace symbolises my move forward and the release of anxiety. The more uplifting rhythm at the end contrasts with the earlier intensity, highlighting the emotional journey from </p>


**What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your work?**

<p>My main aesthetic choices included using colour, movement, and sound. The red light showed anxiety, while the slow change to brighter visuals and light tempo music expressed emotional relief. I also used still shots of objects to show the feeling of being stuck, and fast cuts to show the confusion of anxiety. These choices helped show my journey from feeling anxious to finding peace using both visuals and sounds.</p>

## Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons ##

**How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose the theme that you did?**

<p>The idea behind my set of icons was to create a fun, playful, and family-friendly experience that matches the lively and social environment of a food court. I chose this theme because food courts are not just places to eat; they are spaces where families and friends come together to talk and enjoy each other's company. The icons needed to be visually appealing for younger users, but also easy to use for families. My aim was to show joyful moments by using bright colors and playful designs that make the experience more enjoyable for everyone.</p>

**How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why did you choose the palette that you did?**

<p> I used triad and complementary color schemes for the icons. These color choices added brightness and energy to the designs, fitting well with the playful and lively theme of the food court. I picked this palette because it made the icons stand out while keeping a consistent look throughout the set. For items that needed a softer, calmer feeling, I used an analogous color scheme, which gave the designs a more relaxed look and added some variety to the icon set.</p>

**How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?**

<p>In my audio design, I used sound effects that matched the playful style of the visuals. I included the sound of eating food to highlight the theme of enjoying food, just like the bright colors and bold shapes used in the visual designs. Both the audio and visual parts were made to improve the user experience, making the icons feel interactive and fun. The playful sound effects worked with the visual cues (such as changing the icons from full to partially eaten food) to create a smooth, multisensory experience.</p>

## Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment ##

**How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?**

<p>Sound in this project helped create the right atmosphere and highlight the change from a tech-heavy indoor space to a natural outdoor one. Inside, the looping news reports showed isolation, while the outdoor nature sounds symbolized reconnecting. This was different from Assignments 1 and 2, where sound was mainly used to support the story or add background ambiance, rather than to show a change in the environment.</p>

**How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain themeor concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?**

<p>The theme of isolation to reconnection was brought together through elements like color changes, sound, and layout. At first, the tech-heavy indoor space had darker, colder colors, while the outdoor space was brighter and warmer. As the project developed, I changed the lighting, sound effects, and design to better show the personal journey from isolation during COVID-19 to reconnecting with nature.</p>

**What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have discovered otherwise?**

<p>Through playtesting, I found issues like the short time spent indoors, the need for stronger audio cues, and the need for clearer environmental boundaries. Without playtesting, it would have been hard to notice how confusing the navigation could be for someone new to the space. It also showed technical problems, such as the water plane position and how players interact with the environment.</p>

## Assignment 4 - Portfolio Website ##

**Aesthetic Keywords**

For the aesthetics of my webpage, I want users to associate the following keywords with the design: 

   1. Colourful: Bold, vibrant colours will dominate the design, giving it an energetic and visually exciting look.
   2. Organised: Sections will be well-structured, making it easy for users to navigate through the page and find information efficiently. 
   3.  Clean: The layout will be straightforward, with minimal distractions and plenty of space, allowing content to stand out clearly. 

**Target Audience**

The target audience includes: 

1. Peers: Other students or designers may view my porfolio for inspiration or collaboration opportunities. 
2. Potential Employers and Professionals: They may explore my portfolio to evaluate my style and skills. 

**Features**

1. Responsive and Accessible Design: Mobile-Friendly layout. And make sure the colour contrast, front sizes, and layouts are accessible and easy to read.
2. Visual Consistency and Syle: The web design that reflects my playful and colourful style will give the portfolio a professional look while showing off my personality.  

**Draft of artist statement**

1. Assignment 1 - Video Edit

This video project explores how sound and visuals can express feelings of anxiety and relief. By matching flashing red lights with rising music intensity, I aimed to create an atmosphere that draws viewers into the emotions of the journey. The combination of sound and visuals makes the anxious moments more intense and easy to feel.The main visual choices—colour, movement, and sound—emphasize these emotional changes. The red light stands for anxiety, while the shift to brighter colors and upbeat music shows a sense of relief. This project shows the ups and downs of anxiety and the calm that follows, using sound and visuals to represent a journey from stress to peace.

2. Assignment 2 - Graphic Icon

This set of graphic icons was created to bring out the fun and friendly atmosphere of a food court. I wanted the icons to feel lively, inviting, and suitable for all ages, reflecting the themes of togetherness and enjoyment. By using playful shapes and bold colors, the icons help make the food court experience both functional and engaging.

Colour was an important part of achieving a unified look. I used a mix of triadic and complementary colours to make the icons bright and eye-catching, with softer analogous colors to add balance. This approach keeps the icons visually cohesive and energetic at the same time.

To enhance the playful theme, I added sound effects that match the visuals, like eating sounds that go with food-related icons. Together, these elements create a more interactive experience, inviting users to connect with the icons. Through this mix of colour, shape, and sound, I hope to add a sense of joy and unity to the food court experience.

3. Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment 

This virtual environment project explores the transition from isolation to reconnection. Sound plays a key role in creating the atmosphere, with looping news broadcasts indoors symbolising a sense of confinement and isolation. Outdoors, the sound shifts to natural elements, like birds and flowing water, representing a return to the outside world and connection with nature.

The visual design supports this theme of transition. The indoor space feels cold and restricted, with darker colors and limited lighting. In contrast, the outdoor area is bright and open, using warm colors and natural light to create a welcoming feel. This shift in color and lighting highlights the journey from being confined to feeling free.
