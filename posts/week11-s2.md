## Class Task ##

![layout](W12-layout.jpg)

In class, I applied a grid system to some web pages, experimenting with how content fits into a structured layout. However, I found that many of these pages didn’t align with the grid system as expected. This may be because some of these designs don’t prioritise responsive layouts, or they focus more on artistic expression than on structure and organisation.

This exercise made me reflect on my portfolio webpage design. I want it to look organised and professional, but I’m worried that a strict grid layout might take away from its artistic feel. Balancing structure with creativity will be important. I might use grids for foundational parts while allowing more creative freedom in other sections to keep the design expressive.

In designing my webpage, I decided to use grid columns as part of the background. This idea not only adds a unique visual element but also reflects my background in front-end development. Grids are essential in web layout design and incorporating them as subtle background straps create an artistic look while nodding to my technical skills.

The grid columns give the page structure and alignment, making it feel organized and professional, while also adding a creative touch that keeps it visually engaging. This approach allows me to showcase my coding background in a way that’s both stylish and meaningful.

**Design between Desktop and Mobile**

Here is the design comparison between the desktop and mobile versions of my portfolio webpage. Since mobile screens are smaller, I made a few key adjustments to ensure readability and functionality across devices.

**Key Adjustments**


1. Font Size and Readability: For the mobile design, I increased the font size to make text easier to read on smaller screens. This adjustment ensures that information is accessible without users needing to zoom in.

2. Simplified Layout: On the desktop version, there’s more room to display information side by side, creating a spacious, organized layout. However, for the mobile layout, I stacked elements vertically to fit within the narrow screen, keeping the structure simple and easy to navigate.

3. Consistent Colour and Style: I maintained the bright, colourful theme and striped background across both versions. This consistency helps keep the design cohesive while adapting it for different screen sizes.

4. Enhanced Buttons and Interactivity: I enlarged buttons and other interactive elements for the mobile version, making it easier for users to tap them accurately. This adjustment helps improve the user experience on touchscreens.
