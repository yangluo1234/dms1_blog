## Black Square Activity ##
![Activity](BA.jpg)

Today, I completed the Black Square Activity in the class. This activity allows us to use only black squares to represent several concepts like order, increase, bold, congested, tension and playful. The rule and the purpose of this activity look simple, but as I sson discovered, the simplicity of the task was what made it so challenging.

I began by sketching several ideas on the artboard , focusing on how to arrange these squares to communicate meaning. For example, I used symmetry to symmetry to convey order, placing squares equally in both sides. Conversely, I deliberately placed squares out of whiteframe to create a sense of congestion. Throught out the process, I also adjusted stroke and fill to emphasise different aspects of the squares which I learned from Linkedln. 

Additionally, the design thinking process is applied in this exercise. At the beginning, I defined each concept and then ideated different ways to represent them focusing on space, size and balance. Prototyping was an important part in the process and I tried to produce a range of rough, possible solutions to refine the final design. 

During this process, I learned how to set up my workspace in Illustrator and navigate the different the different tools and panels. The Shape Tool helped me to create squares in different sizes. Furthermore, I experimented with rotating and scaling the squares, which I learned from video. The layers panel helped me keep track of each square's postion and make quick adjustments. However, as a first-time Illustrator user, the biggest challenges I faced was remembering the shortcuts for different tools. I found myself frequently needing to loook them up online as I coundn't recall them all. I get more familiar with the shortcuts after completing this task, as repeated use helped me gradually remember some of them.   

After finishing the activity, I understood better how to communicate complex ideas clearly. It was also a good way to practice design thinking and use the skills I learned from Linkedln Learning. 


## Assignment 2 ##

**Identify**

It is time to start my assignment 2 and I have no idea what I will do or design. After reviewing the Assignment 2 description, the prompts that resonates with me the most are "Future" or "Community". These two concepts I might be interested in and want to explore more. 

**Brainstorming using mindmap**

From my mindmap, I can see what I want to do is about food related but I am not sure which concept I am going to do for this assignment. Each of these prompts offers rich possibilities for creative exploration, and deciding which one to focus on requires considering the platform, context and audience that will best align with my view.

<p>The "Future" is more focused on tech-forward deisgn, appealing to users interested in cutting-edge technologies. In contrast, the "Community" prompt is more about connection, gathering and diversity, attracting people looking for social engagement and shared experiences.</p>

<p>I am leaning toward focusing on the community concept because it allows me to design icons that reflect more human interaction. And the style of the sets of icons can be playful and colourful. I also believe that designing icons for platform like social media applications would give me more creative freedom to explore different representations of objects.</p>

## My Icon Design Project - Icons for Friendly Food Court ##

<p>When designing icons for a food court that targets younger generations and families, it is important to make visuals that feel friendly, fun and playful. The food court is a part of community and is not just a place to eat, it's a space where families or friends gather to share things, socialise and hang-out. Therefore, I want to design a set of icons about food that reflect fun and joful moments. 

This set of icons will be used in food court kiosks and a webapp for ordering food. The kiosks and app need to be simple engough for younger users while also providing a fun and playful way for families with children. </p>

## Platform & Context ##

 **Food Court Kiosks**

 Context: The kiosks will let users easily browse food options, with icons designed to be simple so that customers can quickly recognise the food

 Use Case: Families and younger generations use kiosks when they want a convenient way to order food. 

 **Web App For food Ordering**

 Context: This Web App will allow users to pre-order the food before arriving at the food court or for take-away. 

 Use Case: younger generations will appreciate the quicker way of browsing menus and placing orders via webapp. 


## Audience ##

- Younger Generations: young people will appreciate the playful design, and they enjoy engaging, interactive interfaces.

- Families with children: Parents and children may interact with these icons while ordering food. The icons should be easy to recognise, with bold colours and fun shapes that catch the attention of kids. 

## Design Style ##

To align with the fun and family-friendly atmosphere of the food court, the icons need to be designed in a cute and fun style. 
  - Shapes: Rounded and soft shapes will make the icons look playful and cute. 
  - Colours: Bright and bold colours like bright yellows, reds, blue and greens can create an energetic atmosphere.
  - User-Friendly Icons: this set of icons should be clear and easy to understand for users.
