<p>For this playtest, my friend Leo Chen explored my 3D environment. He enjoys playing PC and online games, and he also work as a software developer, which made him a great tester for his project. After reviewing his feedback and watching the screen recording, I realise there are several areas that need improvement.</p>

<p>First, the time spent in the indoor space was too short. I intended for this space to contrast strongly with the outdoor area, but it didn’t work as planned. The indoor noises were also not as noticeable as I expected, making it hard to show the clear change from isolation to reconnecting with nature.</p>

<p>Second, I noticed that I need to create some kind of boundary to block the player from going outside the intended environment. Currently, there is no clear limit, so the player could accidentally move to the edges of the map.</p>

<p>Lastly, the position of the water plane is not correct. It needs to be adjusted, as the current placement is off and looks unrealistic.</p>

<p>Moving forward, I will extend the time spent in the indoor space and add more sounds to emphasize the contrast. I will also add some barriers or invisible walls to keep the player within the environment and fix the water plane position to make the outdoor area look more realistic.</p>




<p>Plus: There is secret path for an easter egg in my 3D environment. (just want to make it fun and for player to discover!)  :))</p>
