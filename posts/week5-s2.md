## Visual Studio Code ##

<p>I swapped out the existing images in the HTML layout template with my prototype icon designs. Using VScode, I replaced the image path and adjusted the size and positioning of the icons using CSS. </p>

<p>Additionally, I took this project with icon prototypes and pushed it to a Github repo. From there, I used Deno Deploy to easily host and share my work. Deploying with Deno was a smooth process, and I was also able to preview my work locally. The tutorial was clear, and by following it step by step, I successfully built the project on my MackBook like my blog!! </p>
