#  2024 Sem2 DMS1: 13:30 - 16:30 class

This is my daily route from home to RMIT. When I got home, I thought it looked really good, so I took it and used it as the 30s footage. 

## 30s Video for Week1:

<iframe id="week1_video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7XBDrD5xwpg" title="30s of footage" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<script type="module">
    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`week1_video`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16

</script>

## My Software Setup ##

I have just set up everyhing for my upcoming assignments. I downloaded Premiere Pro 2024, Adobe Illustrator 2024, VsCode, and the latest Unity version. I also created accounts for Unity and Figma. All the software is up and running, so I'm all set to dive into my projects.
