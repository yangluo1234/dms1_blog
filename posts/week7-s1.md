## Class Task ##

<p>Today, I started using Unity for the first time to create a solar system project. At the beginning, I found it very difficult to control the anles and manage the camera. It felt like everything was out of control, and I didn't know what I was doing. This was quite frustrating because I had no experience with Unity, and it took me some time to understand how it works.</p>

<p>I followed the steps in the tutorials, and after a while, I started to improve. I learned how to control the camera and direction better, which made me feel a bit more confident. However, I faced another problem was the lighting. Shadows appeared everywhere, and no matter what I did, I couldn't fix them. This issue made me feel even more frustrated.</p>

<p>Since I am still new to Unity, it took me a long time to get things right, and I didn't achieve the results I wanted. Even though the process was slow and difficult, I know that this is part of learning something new. I will keep practising, and I believe that with more time and effort, I will become more comfortable using Unity.</p>

## Brainstorm & Develop for AT3 ##

<p>The first thing that comes to my mind when I reflect on a meaningful change in my life is the COVID-19 period. That time marked a significant change for me, both personally and professionally. It was during this period that my life became centred around working and living from home. It was a time of isolation, heavy reliance of technology, and a complete disconnect from social life and nature. This transformation, will become my theme for my environment design.</p>

## Environment Design Map (draft) ##

## Key Themes of Transformation ##

<p>The first phase of this environment will focus on my experience durint the pandemic, when my life became limited to the boundaries of my home. Every aspect of my life like work, study, and even socialising - became reliant on technology/devices. This environment will begin in small, technology-filled space to show the feeling of isolation and being deeply involuved in a digital life.</p>

<p>Another major aspect of the change I experienced during the covid-19 was the lack of access to the outdoors affected my emitional well-being. This disconnection from nature will be a core element of my environment.</p>

## Environmental Journey and Design ##

<p>The environment will start in a small room full of modern gadgets such as monitors, smartphones, computers, and devices. The space will reflect the monotony of being indoors all the time, consumed by work and study. The atmosphere of this space is cold, dark colours. The notification sounds and keyboard typing sounds will create an overwhelming sense of technological immersion.</p>

<p>The environment will then gradually open up when the door is open, symbolising my realisation that I needed to break away from this isolation. The tone of this part will become warmer and lighter. The sounds of nature such as birds chirping start to replace the digital sounds. </p>

<p>The player will then move into more open, outdoor environment like a valley. This space will feel alive with trees, flowers and a blue sky. This part of the environment will symbolise my rediscovery of nature and the importance of balance in life.</p>

<p>In the ending point of the environment, I will design a peaceful lake to show my connection with wather and nature. The calm water will help create a sense of peace and balance. Gentle sounds of waves will make the player feel relaxed and connected. Through these elements, I want the player to experience the same calm and peace that I feel when I am near water.</p>
