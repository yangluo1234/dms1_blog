## Class Task ##

<p>Today's activity was about wayfinding. We had to find our way to an unfamiliar place near campus, which was a cafe, without using andy digital tools like map apps. During the journey, we were sometimes unsure whether to turn left or right and ended up going the wrong way a few times. To help us, we tried to remember some main buildings as landmarks. On our way back to camputs, we saw the RMIT building, which helped us realise we were on the right path.

<p>The first part of my greybox design focused on creating a natural outdoor space using Unity's terrain tool. I want to build an open world to capture the sense of freedom and calm that comes from being in nature, as this is where I felt most at peace after long periods of isolation of indoors. I started by blocking out the terrain. I shaped the hills, valleys and general landscape to create an immersive environment. Then I added simple paths to guide the player through the environment. These paths connect key areas, such as the house and the lake. Finally, I built forests and lake as lankmarks to help the player orient themselves.</p>

<p>The second part is the indoor space where the player will start his/her journey. This space is meant to feel confined and tech-heavy, reflecting the isolation. I used basic assets to layout the room. There is a bed, tables, and simple furniture to represent the lived-in environment.</p>

<p>However, one challenge I have during this greyboxing process was creating a transition between the indoor and outdoor spaces. I want the shift from the enclosed indoor environment to the open world to feel meaningful and different. In next stage, I will try to build more landmarks and use different sounds to make the transition better. </p>
