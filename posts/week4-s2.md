## Thumbnail sketching activity ##

![Activity](ThumbnailSketchesInClass.jpg)

<p>In the class, I did a quick thumbnail sketching activity to explore different visual ideas for a payment icon. I completed 14/ 20 sketches, each offering a different take on the symbol of currency and the action of payment. During this task, I tried different combinations of symbols and layouts that could clearly show the idea of money and transactions.</p>

<p>As the picture showed above, I explored some of the approaches like dollar signs in various frames. Some of my sketches use the traditional dollar sign encased in a rectangle or circle, which is a direct representation of money. Moreover, I played around with positioning the dollar sign in different ways, including centred or placed within a square like a money note. A few of the sketches include a dollar sign with a shopping cart, suggesting online payment.</p>

<p>The Most effective alternative for me is the dollar sign integrated into a shopping cart. First, these two symbols are universal of commerce. This makes the design recognisable. Second, the design is simple and easy to understand without any confusion at first sight. Third, this icon could easily fit into various platforms and contexts.</p>

<p>However, I found this activity to be particularly challenging and I have not done very well. Time pressure is one of the reasons because I have to generate ideas quickly and then present 20 different icons on paper. By the end of the task, I completed 14/20 only. Another reason is my hand-drawing skills. I always struggled with translating my ideas onto paper. This is the most difficult and frustrating thing for me who wants to learn design, because I am not sure whether others can understand what I am drawing. I am also worried that my design might not be clear because of my drawing skills. Anyway, I will key trying to improve my drawing skills and hope to get better with practice.</p>

## Thumbnail sketches for Assignment 2 ##

![Activity](ThumbnailSketchesForAT2.jpg)

<p>As part of my icon design process, I created a series of thumbnail sketches for various food court related items. The task helped me to think about how to make icons simpler and clearer to my target groups and also how my design aligns with the playful atmosphere. After reviewing my sketches, I have identified and evaluated the best for each icon.</p>

**Best Sketch(Highlighted with a start)**
- Hot Drink (Tea Cup): This sketch shows a simple and easily recognisable cup with a tea bag, giving a feeling of warmth and comfort.

- Japanese food (Sushi): People can easily recognize sushi as a symbol of Japanese food, so I pick sushi as the icon for ordering Japanese dishes. I believe salmon sushi is the most popular, which is why I selected it as the icon. 

- Hamburger: The layering of elements like bun, patty and lettuce is clear without being overly detailed, making the icon instantly recognisable. 

- Bowl of Soup: The bowl is minimalistic, and the steam lines create movement, making the icon dynamic while staying clear and east to understand. 

- Bubble Tea: Bubble Tea is a perfect fit for the playful and vibrant atmosphere of a food court targeting younger generations. The design itself should be cute and simple, making it instantly recognisable. 

- Pizza: A pizza slice is simple, recognisable, and fits well with the overall balance of my icon set, especially because the other icons show only one item each.

- Hot Dog: The rounded edges of the bun make the icon feel soft and playful, which fit well of my design style.

- Sweets (Lollies): Lollipop can represent sweets because it is a classic treat and fit well in a food court. The rounded shape also gives it a cute and cartoon-like quality, making it especially attractive for children.

- Dairy (Milk): This design is classic and easily recognisable without hesitation, and the milk box aligns well with dairy products.
