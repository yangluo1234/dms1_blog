## Footages editing for Week1:

**Basic Editing using Premiere Pro.** 

This week, I've just crated a Youtube account and uploaded my latest experiment video.

In the process of learning editing in Linkedln, I went from not knowing anything to gradually understanding how to import assets, how to organise assets using bins and how to move, copy and delete assets. 

In addition, One key skill I picked up was marking clips: using the 'I' key to mark an in-point and the 'O' key to mark an out-point to define the segments I want to include in my sequence.

I also learned about crossfading in my studio class, which is quite useful for creating smooth transitions between clips. Another technique I got is adding a black layer to change a scene from black and white to colourful.

Overall, I'm pleased with my progress so far and excited to apply them to my future projects.
