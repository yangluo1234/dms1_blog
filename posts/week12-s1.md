## Finalising My Portfolio Webpage ##

As I wrap up my portfolio webpage, I focused on creating a site that appeals to both my peers and potential employers. My aim is to showcase my skills and projects while making it easy for visitors to connect with me.

**Key Sections**

Sticky Navigation Bar: The navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the screen, making it easy for users to access different sections as they scroll down. This feature enhances usability and ensures that visitors can quickly find what they’re looking for.

To avoid making this section overly technical, I used a “bubble” style to display my skills. Each skill appears as a colorful bubble, creating a fun, playful visual that reflects my creative side while still giving a clear overview of my capabilities.

A simple “Contact Me” button allows visitors to email me directly, making it easy for potential employers or collaborators to reach out with opportunities or questions.
