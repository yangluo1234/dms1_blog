## Finalising My Portfolio Webpage ##

As I wrap up my portfolio webpage, I focused on creating a site that appeals to both my peers and potential employers. My aim is to showcase my skills and projects while making it easy for visitors to connect with me.

**Button Design**

To make my portfolio more interactive and user-friendly, I added clickable buttons under each project section that direct viewers to the full project details. These buttons allow potential employers or peers to explore each project more deeply. 

Each buttion is designed in a bold yellow with a shadow effect,making them stand out against the blue background. This ensures the buttons are easily noticeable and allow users to click through to learn more about my work. The shadow effectenhances the aesthetic appeal while keeping the buttons consistent with the playful, colourful theme of my portfolio. In addition, each button is labeled "Click Here" in a readable and clear font. This call-to-action text makes it easy for users to understand that they can click the button for more information.

**Key Sections**

Sticky Navigation Bar: The navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the screen, making it easy for users to access different sections as they scroll down. This feature enhances usability and ensures that visitors can quickly find what they’re looking for.

To avoid making this section overly technical, I used a “bubble” style to display my skills. Each skill appears as a colorful bubble, creating a fun, playful visual that reflects my creative side while still giving a clear overview of my capabilities.

A simple “Contact Me” button allows visitors to email me directly, making it easy for potential employers or collaborators to reach out with opportunities or questions.

**Accessibility**
  
  1. High Contrast: The yellow button on a blue background provides a high contrast, making the button easy to spot and ensuring accessibility for users with visual impairments.

  2. Tap-Friendly Size: The buttons are sized appropriately for mobile and desktop screens, making them easy to tap or click without any difficulty.
